✦ I've analyzed the results. While many core operations (RMSNorm, PagedAttention, RotaryEmbedding, and MoE routing) now
  have Triton or Python fallbacks, there are still several areas with "missed" mock/unimplemented functions.

  Here is a breakdown of what's currently unimplemented or remains as a direct call to a missing C++ backend:

  1. Quantization Kernels (Highly Unimplemented)
  Most specialized quantization schemes still call torch.ops._C and will fail if invoked. These were previously "mocked"
  to do nothing or return empty tensors, but now they will simply raise an AttributeError.
   * AWQ: awq_dequantize, awq_gemm.
   * GPTQ: gptq_gemm, gptq_shuffle.
   * Marlin: gptq_marlin_repack, awq_marlin_repack, marlin_gemm.
   * Cutlass/FP8/FP4: cutlass_scaled_fp4_mm, cutlass_scaled_mm_azp, scaled_fp4_quant, etc.
   * GGUF/GGML: ggml_dequantize, ggml_mul_mat_vec_a8, ggml_moe_a8.

  2. Specialized Cache/Memory Operations
  These are used for KV cache management and specialized attention (like MLA):
   * MLA Cache: concat_and_cache_mla, concat_and_cache_mla_rope_fused.
   * Memory Management: swap_blocks (used for CPU/GPU block swapping), gather_and_maybe_dequant_cache.
   * FP8 Cache: convert_fp8.

  3. Distributed/Communication (Partially Mocked)
  We have a mock parallel_state.py, but several lower-level custom all-reduce operations still point to missing C++
  logic:
   * Custom All-Reduce: init_custom_ar, all_reduce, init_custom_qr.

  4. Specialized Models/Ops
   * Mamba: selective_scan_fwd (Crucial for Mamba models, currently points to _C).
   * Repetition Penalties: apply_repetition_penalties_ (Points to _C, though I added a torch fallback elsewhere).

  5. Remaining "Stubs" in the Code
   * vllm/kernels/triton/fused_attention.py: Contains a comment saying it's a "stub for the full fused implementation."
   * vllm/kernels/helion/register.py: Still contains fake_impl and helion_fake_kernel logic.

  Numerical Summary
  Excluding the core paths I just fixed (which handle standard BF16/FP16 models like Qwen MoE), there are approximately
  80-90 unique functions in vllm/_custom_ops.py that still directly target the C++ backend (torch.ops._C, etc.) without
  a validated Triton/Python replacement.
