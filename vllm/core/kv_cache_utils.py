    list of free blocks. We implement this class instead of using Python
    builtin deque to support removing a block in the middle of the queue
    in O(1) time. To close the performance gap to the builtin deque which is
    implemented in C++, this class does not allocate any Python objects when
    manipulating the linked list. Instead, this class manipulates the
    prev_free_block and next_free_block attributes of the given blocks.

    The queue is ordered by block ID in the beginning. When a block is allocated
    and then freed, it will be appended back with the eviction order:
    1. The least recent used block is at the front (LRU).
    2. If two blocks have the same last accessed time (allocated by the
       same sequence), the one with more hash tokens (the tail of a block
       chain) is at the front.
    Note that we maintain this order by reversing the block order when free
    blocks of a request. This operation is outside of this class.

    Generates the KV cache groups for hybrid models with multiple
    attention types but still with a uniform page size (physical memory per
    block per layer) for all layers.

    Detailed explanation about kv cache management of hybrid models:
    The layers in the models are repeated with some patterns, e.g., a model
    with 10 full attention layers and 20 sliding window attention layers can be
    regarded as repeating the pattern (1 * full, 2 * sw) 10 times.
    The KVCacheManager allocates different block tables for each of the 3 layers
    in the pattern, and repeats each of them 10 times to generate the
    block_table for the 30 layers in the model.
    Therefore, we can group the layers in the model into 3 kv_cache_groups, each
    of which contains 10 layers in the model.
    The KVCacheManager allocates the block_table for each group based on its
    kv_cache spec, and the model runner applies the block table to each layer
    in the group.
    For example:
    1. A model only uses full attention. The pattern is
    (num_hidden_layers * full), so there is only one group and the block table
    is shared by all layers. It is already handled by
    `_get_kv_cache_config_uniform_type`.
    2. A model with 10 full attention layers and 20 sliding window
    attention layers. There are 3 layers in the pattern (1 * full, 2 * sw), so
    there are 3 kv_cache_groups, each of which represents 10 layers.

    To simplify the implementation, we make the following assumptions:
    1. Physical memory per block: Must be the same across all KV cache groups.
    Breaking this assumption is non-trivial due to memory fragmentation concerns
    when allocating blocks of different sizes.
    2. Tokens per block (block_size): Currently, we directly use
    `CacheConfig.block_size` for all layers. It can be extended to vary by KV
    cache group, but within each KV cache group, all layers must share the same
    block size.
    3. Physical memory per token per layer: This property is decided by model
    config. Currently we only support models that have the same physical memory
    per token per layer for all layers. Can be relaxed with a simple extension,
    but still need to keep physical memory per block the same for all groups.
    4. Number of layers per group: Currently assumed the same for all layers.
    Can be relaxed with a simple extension, but still need to keep physical
    memory per block the same for all groups.
    5. Attention type within groups: All layers in a group must share the same
    attention type. One exception is that, when
    `--disable-hybrid-kv-cache-manager` is true, the single group for full
    attention layers may also include attention layers using sliding window or
    LLaMA 4 local attention. See `unify_hybrid_kv_cache_specs` for more details.
    6. Support for multiple attention types: The design for most components is
    general to an arbitrary number of attention types. But
    `find_longest_cache_hit` only supports one attention type or two
    types of full-attention plus exactly one another type. The general
    implementation of this function is feasible but we don't know how to
    implement it cleanly yet.

    As we assume tokens per block, physical memory per token per layer, and
    number of layers per group are the same now, we can ensure that physical
    memory per block is the same for all groups.

    Args:
        kv_cache_spec: The KVCacheSpec of each attention layer in the model
    Returns:
        The generated KVCacheGroupSpecs
    Generate the KV cache configuration from the KV cache groups and spec
    of each layer.

    Args:
        vllm_config: The global VllmConfig
        kv_cache_groups: The KV cache groups
        available_memory: Memory available for KV cache in bytes
    Returns:
        The generated KVCacheConfig
    This function tries to convert the KV cache specs to one type if the model
    is a hybrid model with multiple type of KV cache. It will convert all
    SlidingWindowSpec to FullAttentionSpec if both types are present.

    Args:
        kv_cache_spec: The kv cache spec of each attention layer in the model
    Split the layers in the model into groups with the same KV cache spec.

    Args:
        vllm_config: The global VllmConfig
        kv_cache_spec: The kv cache spec of each attention layer in the model

    Returns:
        The generated KVCacheGroups
    Generate the KV cache configuration for the scheduler.
    Log resolved KV cache configuration.

    Args:
        vllm_config: The global VllmConfig
        kv_cache_config: The resolved KV cache configuration
    Calculate maximum memory usage in bytes from KV cache groups.

    This correctly accounts for padding in hybrid models. For example, if a
    model has 8 full attention layers and 9 sliding window layers, they will
    be padded to 9 full + 9 sliding window for uniform group sizes.
    Binary search for the maximum model length that fits in available memory.
    Returns 0 if even 1 token doesn't fit.
    When max_model_len is set to -1, this function estimates the largest
    context length that can be supported with the available GPU memory.
    It uses binary search to find the maximum length that fits across all
    workers.

    Args:
        vllm_config: The global VllmConfig (will be modified in-place)
        kv_cache_groups: The global KV cache groups (from get_kv_cache_groups).
            This correctly accounts for padding in hybrid models.
        available_memory: Memory available for KV cache in bytes for each
            worker.
    Generates the KV cache configurations for a model.
    Since we use a shared centralized controller for all workers, we need the
    `kv_cache_config` to be consistent across all workers to make sure
    the KV cache allocation can be applied to all workers. However, different
    workers may have different memory available, and different type of layers
    (when pipeline parallel is enabled). To handle the difference between
    workers, the current implementation is:
    1. Merge the KV cache specs of all workers to get the KVCacheSpecs for
       the whole model.
    2. Generate the KV cache groups based on the layer ratio of the whole model.
       This also handles spec unification for hybrid models.
    3. Handle auto-fit max_model_len and memory checks using the unified specs.
    4. Generate the KV cache configs for each worker based on the KV cache
       grouping strategy. (This is reasonable because the layer ratio of
       different PP stages are similar.)
    5. Change the num_blocks of each worker to the smallest among all workers
       and shrink tensor sizes proportionally to avoid allocating unused memory.

    Args:
        vllm_config: The global VllmConfig
        kv_cache_specs: List of dict[layer_name, KVCacheSpec] for each worker.
        available_memory: Memory available for KV cache in bytes for each
            worker.

    Returns:
        The generated KVCacheConfigs for each worker.
    Convert block-hash granularity from `hash_block_size` to `target_block_size`.
    Used when KV cache groups have different block sizes: `hash_block_size`
    is the size used to compute the original `block_hashes`; `target_block_size`
    is the group's actual block size.

    Currently, only scaling up by an integer factor is supported (i.e.,
    `target_block_size` is a multiple of `hash_block_size`). Conversion is
    performed lazily on access for efficiency, by concatenating consecutive
    hashes at `hash_block_size` to form each hash at `target_block_size`.

    Example (`hash_block_size` = 16, `target_block_size` = 32):
    concatenating two 16-size hashes yields one 32-size hash:

    Block hashes with block_size 16:
    | Token Range | 0-15 | 16-31 | 32-47 | 48-63 |
    |-------------|------|-------|-------|-------|
    | Hash        | A    | B     | C     | D     |

    Block hashes with block_size 32:
    | Token Range | 0-31 | 32-63 |
    |-------------|------|-------|
    | Hash        | AB   | CD    |

    Args:
        block_hashes: Block hashes to convert, computed at `hash_block_size`.
        hash_block_size: Block size at which `block_hashes` were computed.
        target_block_size: Desired block size; must be a multiple of `hash_block_size`.
