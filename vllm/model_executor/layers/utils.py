    Applies penalties in place to the logits tensor
    logits : The input logits tensor of shape [num_seqs, vocab_size]
    prompt_tokens_tensor: A tensor containing the prompt tokens. The prompts
        are padded to the maximum prompt length within the batch using
        `vocab_size` as the padding value. The value `vocab_size` is used
        for padding because it does not correspond to any valid token ID
        in the vocabulary.
    output_tokens_tensor: The output tokens tensor.
    presence_penalties: The presence penalties of shape (num_seqs, )
    frequency_penalties: The frequency penalties of shape (num_seqs, )
    repetition_penalties: The repetition penalties of shape (num_seqs, )
